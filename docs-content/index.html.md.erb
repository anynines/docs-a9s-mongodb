This documentation describes the a9s MongoDB for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s MongoDB for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated MongoDB servers and clusters. Developers can create instances of a MongoDB server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application. Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated VM or a set of VMs consisting of multiple VMs containing a MongoDB replica set cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

When you run the cf CLI `create-service a9s-mongodb` command, PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

MongoDB service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated. This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of service instances is not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones, clustered data service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.

### <a id='currentfeatures'></a> Current Features

The current version of a9s MongoDB for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s MongoDB for PCF deploys MongoDB instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM MongoDB server or a multi-VM MongoDB Replica Set using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each MongoDB server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s MongoDB for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized applications.
| **High Availability** | a9s MongoDB for PCF ensures high-availability using <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/" target="_blank">MongoDB **Replica Sets**</a>.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. |
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s MongoDB for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU and storage capacity for your MongoDB instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each MongoDB service instance provides log messages and MongoDB-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s MongoDB for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance. **The instances of one application are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.**|
| **Single to Cluster Updates** | Allow plan updates from single to cluster plans |
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides single sign on and lets the user trigger easily backups. |
| **New MongoDB versions** | Added a9s MongoDB v3.4 and v3.6 |
| **Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile, a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instance created by the user. |
