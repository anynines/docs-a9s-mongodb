This topic describes how to install and configure a9s MongoDB for PCF.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s MongoDB for PCF, ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).


##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure a9s MongoDB for PCF

To install a9s MongoDB for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from the Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** next to the uploaded a9s MongoDB for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab.
	See the following sections for more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab:
	* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
	* [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
	* [Configure Service Plans](#configure-service-instance)
	* [Configure Stemcells](#stemcell)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After installing the a9s MongoDB for PCF, it is available in the list of marketplace services. For more information, see [Using a9s MongoDB for PCF](./using.html).

##<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service instance jobs. You should configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

##<a id='errands'></a>Configure BOSH Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the BOSH Errands used by a9s MongoDB for PCF. See [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](../partners/lifecycle-errands.html)

<%= image_tag("a9s-mongodb-for-pcf-errands.png") %>

### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run BOSH Configurator**
	This errand configures *a9s BOSH for PCF* so that it can provision MongoDB
	service instances. When enabled, this errand uploads the required
	stemcells in the BOSH release. Disabling this errand may speed up the
	deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Template Uploader**
	This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s MongoDB for PCF with MongoDB  configurations.
	Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**
	This errand registers the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker
	at the Elastic Runtime. This causes the service be available in the Elastic Runtime
	marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s MongoDB for PCF
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may
 take a certain amount of time, probably over 30 minutes.

### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**
	This will deregister the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker in Elastic Runtime. This errand removes the a9s MongoDB service from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.

##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plans

The size and types of VMs used to provision service instances of a given service plan are specified in the **IaaS Settings** of the **a9s BOSH for PCF** tile. For more information, see the [a9s BOSH for PCF documentation](../a9s-bosh/installing.html).

Each service plan is defined in the following fields:

| Plan | Specs for | Field |
|------|-------|-------|
|mongodb-single-small| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-cluster-small| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-single-big| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Big|
|mongodb-cluster-big| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Big|

##<a id="stemcell"></a>Configure Stemcells

Use **Configure Stemcells** enable another stemcell than the default one. Click **Import Stemcell** to upload a new stemcell.

##<a id='deployment_updater'></a>Upgrade Existing Service Instances After a Tile Update
This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s MongoDB for PCF service instances to their lastest version after updating the tile.<br />
The errand has to be run manually as explained below.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to run the <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To use the errand you need to know how to use the Ops Manager Director. See this the topic
<a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a> for more informations.</p>
1. SSH into Ops Manager
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
Password: ***********
</pre>
2. Target the BOSH Director
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
Target set to DIRECTOR\_UUID
</pre>
3. Log into BOSH Director
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh login
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>
4. Locate the a9s MongoDB for PCF deployment name.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployments
</pre>
The output should look similar to this:
<pre class="terminal">
Acting as user 'director' on 'p-bosh'

5. All deployment manifests are stored in the folder `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/` .
Choose the `a9s-mongodb-service-...` deployment.
<pre class="terminal">

</pre>
6. Run `bosh run errand deployment-updater` to force a service instances update for all existing a9s MongoDB for PCF instances.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh run errand deployment-updater

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the number of service instances the Deployment Updater takes some time. While the errand is running BOSH shows no logging output from the errand.</p>
