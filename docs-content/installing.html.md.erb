This topic describes how to install and configure a9s MongoDB for PCF.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s MongoDB for PCF, ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).


##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure a9s MongoDB for PCF

To install a9s MongoDB for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from the Pivotal Network.

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** next to the uploaded a9s MongoDB for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab. 
	See the following sections for more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab:
	* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
	* [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
	* [Configure Service Plans](#configure-service-instance)
	* [Configure Stemcells](#stemcell)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After installing the a9s MongoDB for PCF, it is available in the list of marketplace services. For more information, see [Using a9s MongoDB for PCF](./using.html).

##<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service instance jobs. You should configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

##<a id='errands'></a>Configure BOSH Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the BOSH Errands used by a9s MongoDB for PCF. See [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](../partners/lifecycle-errands.html)

### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run BOSH Configurator**
	This errand configures *a9s BOSH for PCF* so that it can provision MongoDB
	service instances. When enabled, this errand uploads the required
	stemcells in the BOSH release. Disabling this errand may speed up the
	deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note">To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Template Uploader**
	This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s MongoDB for PCF with MongoDB  configurations.
	Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note">To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**
	This errand registers the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker
	at the Elastic Runtime. This causes the service be available in the Elastic Runtime
	marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s MongoDB for PCF
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may
 take a certain amount of time, probably over 30 minutes.

### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**
	This will deregister the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker in Elastic Runtime. This errand removes the a9s MongoDB service from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.

##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plans

The size and types of VMs used to provision service instances of a given service plan are specified in the **IaaS Settings** of the **a9s BOSH for PCF** tile. For more information, see the [a9s BOSH for PCF documentation](../a9s-bosh/installing.html).

Each service plan is defined in the following fields:

| Plan | Specs for | Field |
|------|-------|-------|
|mongodb-single-small| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-cluster-small| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-single-big| Virtual Machine<br /> Persistent Disk | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Big|
|mongodb-cluster-big| Virtual Machines<br /> Persistent Disks | Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties fo the Disk Type Big|

##<a id="stemcell"></a>Configure Stemcells

Use **Configure Stemcells** enable another stemcell than the default one. Click **Import Stemcell** to upload a new stemcell.
