This topic describes how to install and configure a9s MongoDB for PCF.


##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s MongoDB for PCF,
ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).

This comprises the **a9s Consul DNS for PCF** tile and the **a9s BOSH for PCF** tile.

The a9s Consul DNS for PCF tile is required because it is responsible
for providing an internal DNS system to the other a9s service tiles, the a9s
MongoDB for PCF included.
For more information about this tile,
see [The Purpose of the a9s Consul DNS for PCF Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-consul-dns/usecase.html).

The a9s BOSH for PCF tile is required because it is used by the a9s
service tiles, for the provisioning and lifecycle management of their VM.
For more information about this tile, see [a9s BOSH for PCF Use Case](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-bosh/usecase.html).


##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure a9s MongoDB for PCF

To install a9s MongoDB for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-mongodb).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** or **+**(depending on the PCF version) next to the uploaded a9s MongoDB for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab.
	See the following sections for more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab:
	* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
	* [Configure the Backup Manager](#backup-manager)
	* [Configure BOSH Errands](#errands)
	* [Configure Resources](#resource-config)
	* [Configure Stemcells](#stemcell)

5. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After installing the a9s MongoDB for PCF, it is available in the list of marketplace services.
For more information, see [Using a9s MongoDB for PCF](./using.html).


###<a id="azs"></a>Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service instance jobs.
You should configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

###<a id='backup-manager'></a>Configure the Backup Manager

Use **Backup settings** to enter the crendentials of the AWS account where the
backup will be uploaded â€“ this feature only supports AWS S3 at the moment. Let
those fields empty if you don't want to backup your data with the a9s MongoDB
for PCF tile.

You can also modify the default values for the backup task and the [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
job that is used to schedule the backups.

<%= image_tag("backup-settings.png") %>

###<a id='errands'></a>Configure Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the lifecycle errands that run when you install or uninstall a9s MongoDB for PCF.
The list below describes each errand.
For more information, see [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

<%= image_tag("a9s-mongodb-for-pcf-errands.png") %>


#### Post-Deploy Errands

 * **Run BOSH Configurator**:
	This errand configures a9s BOSH for PCF so that it can provision MongoDB
  service instances. When enabled, this errand uploads the required releases in
  the a9s BOSH Director. Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of
  all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Template Uploader**:
	This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s MongoDB for PCF with MongoDB  configurations.
	Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

 * **Run Broker Registrar**:
	This errand registers the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker
	at the Elastic Runtime. This causes the service be available in the Elastic Runtime
	marketplace.

 * **Run Smoke Tests**:
 This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s MongoDB for PCF
 installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may
 take a certain amount of time, probably over 30 minutes.

#### Pre-Delete Errands

 * **Delete all a9s MongoDB instances**:
	This errand deletes all a9s MongoDB instances created by PCF end users  with `cf create-service` .
	<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is a destructive task that cannot be undone. It irrecoverably deletes all VMs of the service instances. If a service instance is bound to an app or service keys exist, the errand fails.</p>

 * **Run Broker Deregistrar**:
	This will deregister the a9s MongoDB for PCF service broker in Elastic Runtime. This errand removes the a9s MongoDB service from the Elastic Runtime marketplace.


###<a id='resource-config'></a> Configure Resources

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs that host the a9s MongoDB for PCF components.
This configuration does not cover the dedicated MongoDB instances that run on VMs provided by the a9s BOSH tile for PCF.
For more information, see [Configure Service Plan VMs](#configure-service-instance).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a VM Type of large or greater to support the tile compilation.</p>

<%= image_tag("a9s-mongodb-resource-config.png") %>

###<a id="stemcell"></a>Configure Stemcells

Use **Configure Stemcells** enable another stemcell than the default one. Click **Import Stemcell** to upload a new stemcell.

<%= image_tag("stemcell-tab.png") %>


##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plans

The sizes and types of VMs used to provision service instances of a given service plan are specified in the **Cloud Config** pane of the a9s BOSH for PCF tile. See the <em>Cloud Config</em> section of the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/partners/a9s-bosh/installing.html">a9s BOSH for PCF installation documentation</a> that corresponds to your IaaS.</p>

The table below lists available service plans:

| This plan... | Uses these a9s BOSH for PCF settings to determine VM and disk size |
|------|-------|
|mongodb-single-small| Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-cluster-small| Cloud properties for the VM Type Small<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Small|
|mongodb-single-big| Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|
|mongodb-cluster-big| Cloud properties for the VM Type Large<br /> Cloud properties for the Disk Type Big|


##<a id='deployment_updater'></a>Update Existing Service Instances

After updating the a9s MongoDB for PCF tile, run the Deployment Updater errand to update all provisioned service instances to the new service and stemcell versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: anynines recommends running the <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">smoke tests</a> before running this errand.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To run the errand, you must know how to use the Ops Manager Director. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#prepare" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a>.</p>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM:
<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-FQDN
Password: ***********
</pre>

2. Target the BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
Target set to DIRECTOR\_UUID
</pre>

3. Log in to the BOSH Director:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh login
Your username: director
Enter password: DIRECTOR\_CREDENTIAL
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>

4. Run `bosh deployments` and record the name of the a9s MongoDB for PCF deployment from the **Name** column:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployments
Acting as user 'director' on 'p-bosh'
+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
| Name                                      | Release(s)                    | Stemcell(s)
+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
| a9s-bosh-a40c3b10d101faca4fbc             | bosh-aws-cpi/53               | bosh-vsphere
| ...
+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
| a9s-consul-dns-3f3a49fb941f8c0874cb       | consul/9                      | bosh-vsphere
| ...
+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
| a9s-mongodb-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd  | bosh-configurator-mongodb/3   | bosh-vsphere
| ...
+-------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------
</pre>

5. Switch the CLI to operate on the a9s MongoDB for PCF deployment by running `bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/DEPLOYMENT-NAME.yml` with the `a9s-mongodb-service-...` name from the previous step:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/a9s-mongodb-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd.yml
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                               Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   352  100   352    0     0  12014      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 12137
Deployment set to '/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/a9s-mongodb-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd.yml'</pre>

6. Run `bosh run errand deployment-updater` to force the update for all existing a9s MongoDB for PCF instances:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh run errand deployment-updater
% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                               Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   352  100   352    0     0  26378      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 27076
Acting as user 'director' on deployment 'a9s-mongodb-service-94443f82b52dcf333bbd' on 'p-bosh'
&nbsp;
Director task 6533
Started preparing deployment > Preparing deployment. Done (00:00:01)
&nbsp;
...
&nbsp;
Errand 'deployment-updater' completed successfully (exit code 0)
</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Depending on the number of service instances, the Deployment Updater may take significant time to finish running. BOSH shows no logging output while the errand runs.</p>

##<a id='interacting-with-the-backup-manager'></a> Interacting with the Backup Manager

For the moment, only PCF administrators can interact with the Backup Manager
endpoints to trigger immediate backups and restore backups. We plan to extend this
function to PCF users as well in the near future.

To perform backups and restores, you need to go in the a9s MongoDB for PCF tile,
find out the IP of the one of the Backup Manager instances in the **Status** tab and the
credentials of the service in the **Credentials** under the *backup-manager* job
and the name *Backup Manager Credentials*

<%= image_tag("backup-manager-status-tab.png", width: 320) %>
<%= image_tag("backup-manager-credentials.png", width: 320) %>

Once you have this information, you can trigger a backup on all instances by
calling the **/backup\_agent/backup\_all** endpoint:

```
$ curl backup:53cr3t@172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/backup_all -d {}
```

or on a given instance with its GUID by calling the **/backup\_agent/backup**
endpoint:

```
$ curl backup:53cr3t@172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/backup -d "instance_guid=1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9"
```

Before performing a restore, you will need to find the ID of the Backup and the
ID of the instance. You can do so by listing the instances:

```
$ curl backup:53cr3t@172.28.7.64:3000/instances
```

This command outputs an array composed of objects like this one:

```
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
      "backup_agent_task": {
        "updated_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:31.389Z",
        "created_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:16.064Z",
        "status": "done",
        "task_id": 5,
        "id": 5
      },
      "instance_id": 1,
      "id": 5
    }
  ],
  "instance_id": "1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9",
  "id": 1
}
```

You can see there backups and restores that have been performed in the past for
the instance with the instance_id "1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9". This
ID corresponds to the instance GUID from Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Then you can restore your backup by calling the **/backup\_agent/restores**
endpoint with the backup\_id and instance\_id as data.

```
$ curl backup:53cr3t@172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/restores -d "backup_id=5" -d "instance_id=1"
```
